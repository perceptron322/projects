        </div>
        <p>
            Established in 1974 by entrepreneur Robert Thompson, Threads & Strides emerged as a fashion-forward
            brand committed to redefining the way people dressed. Starting as a small workshop, the company gained
            recognition for its craftsmanship, initially focusing on high-quality trousers and later diversifying
            into stylish jackets.

            As the '80s unfolded, Threads & Strides continued to evolve, incorporating new fabrics and designs
            into
            its repertoire. The '90s saw further diversification with the introduction of a line of comfortable yet
            chic shirts and a range of footwear that combined fashion with functionality.

            Expanding globally in the 2000s, Threads & Strides opened flagship stores in fashion capitals
            worldwide,
            solidifying its position as a global fashion powerhouse. The product range expanded to include a diverse
            array of clothing, from casual wear to formal attire.

            In response to growing environmental awareness in the 2010s, Threads & Strides embraced
            sustainability,
            implementing eco-friendly practices in production. The company became a symbol of responsible fashion,
            contributing to various social and environmental causes.

            Today, with nearly five decades of experience, Threads & Strides continues to evolve. The product
            line
            includes cutting-edge designs in shirts, jackets, shoes, and trousers, all crafted with a perfect blend
            of tradition and modernity. Committed to quality, style, and sustainability, Threads & Strides offers
            customers a wardrobe that reflects individuality while contributing to a better world.

            Looking towards the future, Threads & Strides remains dedicated to its legacy of innovation and
            timeless
            style, ensuring that the journey that began in 1974 continues to shape the fashion landscape for

            <h2>Premium materials</h2>
            <p>When it comes to choosing materials for our shirts, natural fibers offer several benefits. Here
                are some
                reasons why using natural materials in our shirts is a good choice:
                Breathability: Natural fibers like linen or cotton allow our skin to breathe, keeping us cool in
                hot
                weather and warm in cold weather. This breathability helps regulate body temperature and
                prevents
                discomfort caused by sweating.
                Comfort: Clothing made from natural fibers is softer and more comfortable to wear compared to
                synthetic
                materials. Natural fibers feel gentle against the skin and provide a comfortable and cozy
                feeling
                throughout the day.
                Hypoallergenic: Natural fabrics such as silk, cotton, and linen are hypoallergenic in nature.
                They are
                less likely to cause skin irritations or allergies, making them suitable for people with
                sensitive skin.
                Sustainability: Natural materials are often more sustainable and eco-friendly compared to
                synthetic
                fabrics. They are biodegradable and have a lower environmental impact during production and
                disposal.
                By choosing shirts made from natural materials, you can enjoy the benefits of breathability,
                comfort,
                sustainability, and durability while supporting a more eco-friendly and skin-friendly wardrobe.
